LegalGrep
=========

What<br/>
LegalGrep is a legal research tool that highlight all passages in a document A containing terms B &amp; C within a proximity of D words.

Why<br/>
@nealrs built this because a friend asked him if it was possible to do the above. Apparently LexisNexis & WestLaw are capable of similiar searches for leagl research - but only if you already have the document catalogued in their system. LegalGrep is built for text from anywhere.

How<br/>
Bootstrap, PHP, jQuery, the <a href="https://github.com/mistic100/jQuery-highlightTextarea">highlightTextarea plugin written by mistic100</a>, and a whole lot of RegEx love from @ericjustusson
