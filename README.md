LegalGrep
=========

<strong>What is LegalGrep?</strong><br/>
LegalGrep is a legal research tool that highlights all passages within a document A containing terms B &amp; C within a set proximity of D words. The app accepts leading, trailing, and mid-word wild cards, and does birectional searches (AxxB & BxxA). When you print, make sure to turn on 'background colors and images'.

<strong>Can I try it out?</strong><br/>
Sure, check out the <a href="http://nealshyam.com/legal">live demo</a>.

<strong>Why did you make this?</strong><br/>
A lawyer friend asked me if I could build a simple tool to do this, because while Lexis Nexis & West Law are capable of such searches, they only work for content they've already catalogued. LegalGrep works with any text you paste in (or from anywhere on the web via the bookmarklet). If you review a lot of financial documents (e.g 10ks), this might also be useful to you.

<strong>How did you make it?</strong><br/>
LegalGrep was built using Bootstrap, PHP, jQuery, and a heavly modified version of <a href="https://github.com/mistic100/">mistic100</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/mistic100/jQuery-highlightTextarea">highlightTextarea plugin</a> - along with RegEx wizardy & spiritual guidance from <a href="https://github.com/EricJustusson">@ericjustusson</a>.
