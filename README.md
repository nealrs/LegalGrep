LegalGrep
=========

What?<br/>
LegalGrep is a legal research tool that highlight all passages in a document A containing terms B &amp; C within a proximity of D words. The app accepts both leading and trailing wild cards. The textbox is not scrollable onscreen, but printing will give you the full highlighted text. (just make sure to turn on 'background colors and images')

Why?<br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/nealrs">@nealrs</a> built this because a friend asked him if it was possible to do the above. Apparently Lexis Nexis & West Law are capable of similiar searches for legal research - but only if you already have the document catalogued in their system. LegalGrep is built for text from anywhere.

How?<br/>
Bootstrap, PHP, jQuery, <a href="https://github.com/mistic100/">mistic100</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/mistic100/jQuery-highlightTextarea">highlightTextarea plugin</a>, and RegEx wizardy / spiritual guidance courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/EricJustusson">@ericjustusson</a>
