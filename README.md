#LegalGrep

##What is LegalGrep?
LegalGrep is a legal research tool that highlights all passages containing terms A &amp; B within a set proximity of C words within a document D. The app accepts wild cards (leading, mid, trailing), and does birectional searches (AxxB & BxxA).

##Can I try it out?
Sure, check out the <a href="http://legalgrep.com/">live demo</a> hosted on GitHub.

##Why did you make this?
A lawyer friend asked me if I could build a simple tool to do this, because while Lexis Nexis & West Law are the industry standard for legal research, they only work with content they've already catalogued. LegalGrep works with any text you supply it. And, if you review a lot of financial documents (e.g 10ks) or M&A contracts, this may also be useful for you.

##How did you make it?
LegalGrep was built using Bootstrap, underscore.js, preg_quote.js, jQuery, and a heavily modified version of <a href="https://github.com/mistic100/">mistic100</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/mistic100/jQuery-highlightTextarea">highlightTextarea plugin</a> - along with RegEx wizardy & spiritual guidance from <a href="https://github.com/EricJustusson">@ericjustusson</a>.
