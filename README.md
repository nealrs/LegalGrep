LegalGrep
=========

<strong>What is LegalGrep?</strong><br/>
LegalGrep is a legal research tool that highlight all passages in a document A containing terms B &amp; C within a proximity of D words. The app accepts both leading & trailing wild cards and does birectional searches (AxxB & BxxA). Print to export to PDF & view the full highlighted text. (make sure to turn on 'background colors and images')

<strong>Why did you make this?</strong><br/>
A lawyer friend asked me if I could build this, I wanted to try out Bootstrap, I had some free time, and I like prototyping small apps. Other attorneys have since informed me that while Lexis Nexis & West Law are capable of such searches, they only work for content they've already catalogued. LegalGrep works with any text you paste in (or from anywhere on the web via the bookmarklet). If you review a lot of financial documents (e.g 10ks), this might also be useful to you.

<strong>How did you make it?</strong><br/>
Bootstrap, PHP, jQuery, and <a href="https://github.com/mistic100/">mistic100</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/mistic100/jQuery-highlightTextarea">highlightTextarea plugin</a> - along with RegEx wizardy & spiritual guidance from <a href="https://github.com/EricJustusson">@ericjustusson</a>
