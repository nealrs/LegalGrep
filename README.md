#LegalGrep

##What is LegalGrep?
LegalGrep is a legal research tool that highlights all passages containing terms A &amp; B within a set proximity of C words within a document D. The app accepts wild cards (leading, mid, trailing), and does birectional searches (AxxB & BxxA).

##Can I try it out?
Sure, check out the [live demo](http://legalgrep.com).

##Why did you make this?
A lawyer friend asked me if I could build a simple tool to do this, because while Lexis Nexis & West Law are the industry standard for legal research, they only work with content they've already catalogued. LegalGrep works with any text you supply it. And, if you review a lot of financial documents (e.g 10ks) or M&A contracts, this may also be useful for you.

##How did you do it?
LegalGrep was built using Bootstrap, underscore.js, preg_quote.js, jQuery, and a heavily modified version of [mistic100](https://github.com/mistic100)'s [highlightTextarea plugin](https://github.com/mistic100/jQuery-highlightTextarea) - along with RegEx wizardy & spiritual guidance from [Eric Justusson](https://github.com/EricJustusson).
